Q-TIPS® is a registered trademark of Unilever and is NOT a name for just any cotton swabs. The Q-TIPS® trademark can only be used to refer to the specific cotton swab products manufactured and sold by Unilever and should not be used to refer to cotton swab products of other companies or to cotton swabs generally. Appropriate generic terminology for cotton swabs includes the terms "cotton", "stick(s)" and "swab(s)". Misuse of the Q-TIPS® trademark constitutes an infringement of Unilever's exclusive rights in the mark.

Use of the Q-TIPS survey is only for educational purposes and has no association with cotton swabs.
